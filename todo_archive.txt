### Phase 1: Correct the Foundational Algorithms âœ… COMPLETED

First, fix the broken parts. All subsequent steps rely on a correct and efficient foundation.

* **1. Implement Efficient Modular Exponentiation:**
    * [x] **Action:** Delete your custom `mod_mersenne` function.
    * [x] **Action:** Everywhere you need modular exponentiation, use the `modpow` method from the `num-bigint` crate. It's vastly more efficient.

* **2. Fix the Small Factor Check:**
    * [x] **Action:** In `check_small_factors`, replace the call to `mod_mersenne` with `num_bigint::modpow`.
    * [x] **Logic:** The check must confirm that $2^p \equiv 1 \pmod q$, where `q` is the potential factor.
    * [x] **Fix:** Added check to prevent M_p itself from being reported as a factor.

* **3. Upgrade the Probabilistic Test:**
    * [x] **Action:** Correct the `fermat_test` to use the proper exponent: $(2^p - 1) - 1$.
    * [x] **Recommendation:** For a world-class tool, replace the Fermat test with the **Miller-Rabin test**. It's a strictly stronger probabilistic test that is standard practice. You can find many Rust implementations or write your own using your new `modpow` skill.

### Phase 2: Implement the Definitive Test âœ… COMPLETED

This is the most important part of the libraryâ€”the test that gives the final "yes" or "no".

* **1. Implement the Lucas-Lehmer Test (LLT):**
    * [x] **Action:** Create a new function, `lucas_lehmer_test(p: u64) -> bool`.
    * [x] **Logic:**
        1.  Start with $s = 4$.
        2.  The modulus is $M_p = 2^p - 1$.
        3.  Loop $p-2$ times, calculating $s = (s^2 - 2) \pmod{M_p}$ in each iteration.
        4.  The test passes if and only if the final result is $s=0$.
    * [x] **Tests:** Verified with known Mersenne primes (M7, M13, M17, M19, M31) and composites (M11, M23, M29).

***

### Phase 3: Engineer the Test Cascade âœ… COMPLETED

Re-design your `CheckLevel`s and testing logic to create an efficient pipeline that fails as fast as possible.

* **1. Redefine `CheckLevel`:**
    * [x] **Action:** Rename your `CheckLevel` enum variants to reflect their purpose in the cascade.
    * [x] **Structure Implemented:**
        * `PreScreen`: Checks if the exponent `p` itself is prime. **This must be the very first step.**
        * `TrialFactoring`: Your corrected `check_small_factors` routine. This is a fast way to find small factors.
        * `Probabilistic`: The Miller-Rabin test. This will eliminate virtually all remaining composites without the high cost of the LLT.
        * `LucasLehmer`: The full, definitive LLT. This is the final, most expensive step.

* **2. Refactor `check_mersenne_candidate`:**
    * [x] **Action:** Rewrite the function to be a strict pipeline. It should take a *single* `CheckLevel` and run all tests up to and including that level.
    * [x] **Logic:** If any test fails, the function should return immediately with a `false` result. This prevents wasting time on numbers that are already proven to be composite.
    * [x] **Updates:** Updated all interfaces (Rust API, Python bindings, CLI, documentation) to reflect the new cascade structure.

### Phase 4: Achieve Elite Performance ðŸš€

For numbers with 100 million digits, standard `BigUint` math is too slow. These optimizations are what separate good tools from world-class ones.

* **1. Implement Optimized Modulo for LLT:**
    * [x] **Action:** The LLT only ever uses modulo $M_p = 2^p-1$. This operation can be done extremely quickly without division.
    * [x] **Algorithm:** For a number `k`, the operation `k mod (2^p-1)` is equivalent to repeatedly taking the bits beyond position `p`, shifting them down, and adding them to the lower `p` bits until no bits remain above `p`. This bitwise trick is a massive speedup.
    * [x] **Goal:** Create a specialized `square_and_subtract_two_mod_mp` function that uses this trick instead of a generic `modpow`.
    * [x] **Note:** Implemented the function structure but using standard modulo for now. The bitwise optimization requires careful handling of edge cases to avoid infinite loops.

* **2. (Advanced) FFT Multiplication:**
    * [ ] **Note:** This is an advanced, long-term goal for maximum performance.
    * [ ] **Concept:** For the massive numbers involved in the LLT's squaring step, multiplication using the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** is asymptotically faster than the classic algorithms used in `num-bigint`.
    * [ ] **Path:** When you're ready, research libraries like `rust-fft` and how they can be used to implement what's known as "Number Theoretic Transform" for large number multiplication.

***

### Phase 5: Final Polish and Release âœ… COMPLETED

* **1. Enhance CI/CD:**
    * [x] **Action:** Update your `.github/workflows/rust.yml` to include jobs for `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`.
    * [x] **Action:** Add caching to the workflow to speed up builds.

* **2. Fix Project Configuration:**
    * [x] **Action:** Decide on a version number and make `Cargo.toml` and `pyproject.toml` consistent.
    * [x] **Action:** Remove `Cargo.lock` from `.gitignore` and commit the file to ensure reproducible builds.

* **3. Update All Documentation:**
    * [x] **Action:** Thoroughly update `README.md` and all Rustdoc comments.
    * [x] **Content:** Explain the new testing cascade, the correctness of the algorithms, and credit the sources for advanced algorithms (e.g., the modulo trick used by GIMPS). This transparency builds trust and academic credibility.
