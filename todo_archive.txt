**Phase 1: Correct the Foundational Algorithms**
- ‚úÖ Replaced custom `mod_mersenne` with efficient `num-bigint::modpow`
- ‚úÖ Fixed small factor checking with proper modular arithmetic
- ‚úÖ Corrected Fermat test with proper exponent `(2^p - 1) - 1`

**Phase 2: Implement the Definitive Test**
- ‚úÖ Implemented the Lucas-Lehmer test (LLT) as the definitive primality test
- ‚úÖ Verified with known Mersenne primes (M7, M13, M17, M19, M31) and composites (M11, M23, M29)

**Phase 3: Engineer the Test Cascade**
- ‚úÖ Redefined `CheckLevel` enum with proper cascade structure:
  - `PreScreen`: Check if exponent p is prime (instant)
  - `TrialFactoring`: Check for small factors (~1 second)
  - `Probabilistic`: Miller-Rabin test (seconds to minutes)
  - `LucasLehmer`: Definitive test (minutes to hours)
- ‚úÖ Implemented strict pipeline that fails fast
- ‚úÖ Updated all interfaces (Rust API, Python bindings, CLI, documentation)

**Phase 4: Achieve Elite Performance**
- ‚úÖ Implemented Miller-Rabin test (stronger than Fermat test)
- ‚úÖ **CRITICAL: Implemented optimized bitwise modulo operations for LLT**
- ‚úÖ Added specialized `square_and_subtract_two_mod_mp` function with bitwise optimization
- ‚úÖ This is the key optimization that makes serious prime hunting feasible

**Phase 5: Final Polish and Release**
- ‚úÖ Enhanced CI/CD with formatting, linting, and caching
- ‚úÖ Fixed project configuration (version consistency, Cargo.lock)
- ‚úÖ Updated all documentation with proper explanations and credits

### üîß Critical Refinements Completed

**Code Quality Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed `unwrap()` panic in `check_small_factors` for large exponents
- ‚úÖ Fixed timeout bug in `miller_rabin_test` to respect overall cascade timeout
- ‚úÖ Removed unused `check_mersenne_properties` function (dead code)
- ‚úÖ Fixed all clippy warnings and code quality issues

**Documentation Updates:**
- ‚úÖ Updated README.md to reflect Miller-Rabin test (not Fermat)
- ‚úÖ Fixed Performance Considerations section to reference correct `CheckLevel` names
- ‚úÖ Updated version history to reflect all major improvements
