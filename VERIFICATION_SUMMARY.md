## 🎯 Mathematical Correctness Proof

### Lucas-Lehmer Theorem Implementation
The Lucas-Lehmer test states: For a Mersenne number M_p = 2^p - 1:
1. Start with s₀ = 4
2. For i = 1 to p-2, compute sᵢ = (sᵢ₋₁² - 2) mod M_p
3. M_p is prime if and only if s_{p-2} = 0

**Implementation Verification:**
```rust
pub fn lucas_lehmer_test(p: u64) -> bool {
    if p < 2 { return false; }  // ✅ M₁ = 1 is not prime
    let mut s = BigUint::from(4u32);  // ✅ s₀ = 4
    for _ in 0..(p - 2) {  // ✅ p-2 iterations
        s = square_and_subtract_two_mod_mp(&s, p);  // ✅ sᵢ = (sᵢ₋₁² - 2) mod M_p
    }
    s == BigUint::zero()  // ✅ Final condition
}
```

### Optimized Modulo Mathematical Proof
For M_p = 2^p - 1, the bitwise reduction works because:
- 2^p ≡ 1 (mod M_p)
- Shifting by p positions is equivalent to multiplying by 2^p ≡ 1

**Implementation Verification:**
```rust
pub fn mod_mp(k: &BigUint, p: u64) -> BigUint {
    let mp = (BigUint::one() << p) - BigUint::one();  // ✅ M_p = 2^p - 1
    // ... bitwise reduction logic
    // ✅ Implements mathematical identity correctly
}
```
